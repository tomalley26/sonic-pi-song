### Song Title: Chill Piano House Study Mix 06

This example music piece was live coded in Sonic Pi. I was inspired by EDM, house, and techno music that I enjoy listening to. This song's main components include a beat (snare, bass, hi hat), an initial prelude bassline and bassline, two groups of synth beeps, repeated piano chords, and a 'wobble / reverb' bassline. In my code, I also experimented with Sonic Pi's note mirroring and chord progression capabilities. By organizing all of these elements of the song into their own 'live_loop' sections, I was able to add and delete the 'stop' keyword to pause and play each section as I wished. The majority of my live coding strategy was to gradually bring in each song element one at a time (e.g. start with the beat, then introduce the bassline, then chords, etc.) While bringing song elements in and out, I also experimented with the note amplitude levels to create dynamics. For example, I changed the amp levels of the synth beats and the basslines for different dynamic effects. I also experimented with the beat by removing certain elements once in a while (such as the hi hat or the kick) to bring the listener's attention to different parts of the song.
